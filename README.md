One exemple

I'll give you an example.

Say you have ABC.ISO and you want DEF.ISO.

I happen to have ABC.ISO and DEF.ISO.

I make an SVF of the ABC.ISO and DEF.ISO

You take your ABC.ISO and apply my SVF that I made (ABC+DEF=SVF) and you get DEF.ISO (ABC+SVF=DEF)

Instead of having to DL the entire DEF.ISO that could be 4GB, the patch might only be 1kb to 500kb instead of the full 4GB.

What the SVF patch consists of is, everything that is different between the ABC.ISO and the DEF.ISO. So the less differences between the two ISO's the smaller the patch usually is, in general.
Â 
After the extraction go to msdn technet Microsoft to check you iso SHA-1 OR MD5 and use checksum to say the MD5 or Sha1 if is exactly equal the iso you have 
Extracted is original and you can use is free of virus or other potential malware
